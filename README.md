VidCutter packages for Ubuntu

This repo contains binary amd64 packages for Ubuntu, which I built using the official source from Github. I'm not quite fond of snaps.
The only modification is to add a proper note the changelog and bumping the version number (original changelog has not been updated for quite some time).

All credit goes to ozmartian (Pete Alexandrou).
